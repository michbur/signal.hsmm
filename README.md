=========================
Predict Presence of Signal Peptides
-------------------------

signal.hsmm predicts presence of signal peptides in eukaryotic protein using
hidden semi-Markov models. The implemented algorithm can be accessed as a web-based service http://michbur.shinyapps.io/signalhsmm/ or from command line:

```R
run_signal.hsmm()
```

The GUI can be also started locally using:

```R
gui_signal.hsmm()
```
